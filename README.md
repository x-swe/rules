# Rules

If you think something needs to be re-defined, please forks this repo and send a PR and we will review it. There is a current restriction of 160 characters so take that in mind!

1. **Be kind and respectful.** - This will all be way more fun if everyone is nice to each other. You can disagree on something while not making it personal.

2. **Stick to the topic in posts.** - This is a community for Software Engineering. For anything else, please post in another appropriate community. Also don't use non-relevant hashtags in posts.

3. **Promote only meaningful content.** - No ads, self-promo, or other kinds of promotions. OSS/FOSS projects are excepted. No use of URL shorteners.

4. **No qoute posting.** - Don't paste your post link here, create a community post and select "Also share with followers" for better reach. Avoid replying to posts with new quote posts.

5. **No general career advice.** - Career advice posts must include questions or discussions that benefit aspiring or professional software engineers. Avoid asking questions just for engagement.

6. **No spamming.** - Don't spam the same content. Avoid using #news and limit to 2 hashtags per post. No follow-for-follow requests. Repeated spamming may result in a ban.

7. **No memes.** - Although we love memes, we want to have a community of serious discourse. Find another appropriate community for memes.

8. **No posts in languages other than English.** - The only language that should be used here is English. And that includes links to resources as well.

9. **No low-effort posts.** - Avoid posts with bare links or reposts without insightful comments. Very short posts that don't encourage discussion are also considered low-effort.
